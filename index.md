### "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." - Carl Sagan

Hello!

I am a planetarian at the Science Museum of Virginia, as well as a post-baccalaureate researcher with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's MaNGA Survey. Additionally, I teach robotics to middle-schoolers, which is both fun and challenging to do virtually!

In 2020, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics, and I previously earned my Associate of Science from Reynolds Community College.
