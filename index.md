## Welcome

Hello! I'm Mariarosa Marinelli, a senior in the Physics Department at Virginia Commonwealth University, a planetarian at the Science Museum of Virginia, and an undergraduate researcher with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's MaNGA Survey.

I want to understand how the universe works, and share that knowledge with others.
