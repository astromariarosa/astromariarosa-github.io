### "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." - Carl Sagan

Hello!

I am a planetarian at the Science Museum of Virginia, where I research, script, and deliver live astronomy shows to a wide range of audiences. Additionally, I work with a local nonprofit to teach robotics to middle-schoolers in the city of Richmond, which is both fun and challenging to do virtually. I am also a post-baccalaureate researcher with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's MaNGA Survey.

In 2020, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics, and I previously earned my Associate of Science from Reynolds Community College.
