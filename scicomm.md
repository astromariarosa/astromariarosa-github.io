## Science Communication

As a planetarium presenter at the Science Museum of Virginia's Dome Theater, I research, write, code, and present material for live astronomy shows geared towards a variety of audiences. Beyond exploration of visible constellations, planets, and current planetary missions, I've delved into a wide range of topics, including  exoplanet discovery, star formation, galaxy evolution, general relativity, and radio astronomy.


## Education and Public Outreach

I am currently a Robotics Instructor with a local nonprofit. I teach after-school and extracurricular classes on the basics of robotics, engineering, and computer science to middle-school students in Richmond, Virginia.

Previously at the Science Museum of Virginia, I completed offsite outreach visits to after-school programs to lead hands-on engineering and science activities with middle-schoolers in central Virginia. Additionally, I worked in gallery labs, trained animals, performed science demonstrations, and led classes for visiting groups.

During the 2019 West Virginia Governor's STEM Institute at Green Bank Observatory, I mentored rising ninth-graders as they collected and analyzed data. Over two weeks, my research group was able to detect neutral hydrogen gas in M31 and M33 using the 40-foot Telescope, 20-meter Telescope, and the Green Bank Telescope.
