# Science Communication and Outreach

### Astronomy Education

As a planetarium presenter at the Science Museum of Virginia's Dome Theater, I research, write, code, and present material for live astronomy shows geared towards a variety of audiences. I co-lead our monthly Science After Dark Cosmic Expeditions, focusing on a new topic each month. Past topics have included exoplanet discovery, galaxy evolution, general relativity, Mars, dwarf planets, and radio astronomy. 

### Mentoring

During the 2019 West Virginia Governor's STEM Institute at Green Bank Observatory, I mentored rising ninth-graders as they collected and analyzed data. Over two weeks, my research group was able to detect neutral hydrogen gas in M31 and M33 using the 40-foot Telescope, 20-meter Telescope, and the Green Bank Telescope.

### Gallery Education, STEM Outreach

Working in the Education Department at the Science Museum of Virginia, I worked in gallery labs, trained animals, performed science demonstrations, and led classes for visiting groups. Additionally, I completed offsite outreach visits to after-school programs to lead hands-on engineering and science activities with middle-schoolers in central Virginia.
